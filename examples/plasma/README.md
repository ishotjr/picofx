## Effect Examples

### Pulse Wave
[effects/pulse_wave.py](effects/pulse_wave.py)

Play a wave of pulses on Plasma 2040's strip output.
This is an *experimental* feature, that can struggle when
complex effects with high update rates are applied to many LEDs.


### Binary Counter
[effects/binary_counter.py](effects/binary_counter.py)

Play a binary counter effect on Plasma 2040's strip output.
This is an *experimental* feature, that can struggle when
complex effects with high update rates are applied to many LEDs.


### Rainbow Wave
[effects/rainbow_wave.py](effects/rainbow_wave.py)

Play a rainbow wave effect on Plasma 2040's strip output.
This is an *experimental* feature, that can struggle when
complex effects with high update rates are applied to many LEDs.
